"""Process- and host-local leases for persistent MCP compaction archives.

SQLite serializes writes, but two live agent sessions must not share one
archive because their recall budgets and message histories are independent.
This module combines an in-process registry with a non-blocking OS file lock
and releases both when the corresponding compaction resource closes.
