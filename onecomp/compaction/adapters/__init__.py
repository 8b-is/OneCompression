"""Framework adapters for the ARC compaction engine.

Concrete adapters (mini-swe-agent, LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents,
custom MAS orchestrators, ...) live here, one module per framework, so
that framework dependencies never leak into the core layers.

An adapter wires exactly three touchpoints of
:class:`onecomp.compaction.engine.ArcEngine` into the host framework:

1.  Append ``engine.system_prompt_snippet()`` to the system prompt.
2.  In the agent step loop, call ``engine.begin_step()`` per LLM
    response and pass each emitted action through
    ``engine.handle_action(action, messages)`` before executing it.
    A :class:`~onecomp.compaction.engine.RecallOutcome` means the turn
    was served from the store (skip execution); a
    :class:`~onecomp.compaction.engine.RecallError` should be fed back
    to the LLM as this turn's observation.  After a real execution,
    register the result with ``engine.record_observation`` and append
    ``engine.make_observation_message(record, rendered=...)``.
3.  On a context-window overflow — detected with
    :func:`matches_context_overflow` or the framework's own typed
    exception — replace the buffer with ``engine.compact(messages)``
    and retry.  For proactive trimming, use
    ``engine.enforce_char_budget(messages, max_chars)`` before each
    request.

If the target LLM API rejects message fields other than
``role``/``content``, send ``sanitize_messages(messages)`` and keep the
tagged originals as the source of truth.
