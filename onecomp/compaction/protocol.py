"""The ``_recall`` / ``_recall_meta`` protocol: regexes, citation and
metadata formatters, and the system-prompt snippet.

When an agent's single action matches ``_recall §<obs_id>`` or
``_recall_meta §<obs_id>``, the integration layer intercepts the action
*before* the environment executes it and re-injects either the full
stored observation (``_recall``) or a bounded metadata preview
(``_recall_meta``) as a user-role message.  This module is the pure half
of that flow: parsing and rendering only, no state.

Two variants are supported:

``_recall §<id>``
    The verbatim, lossless observation is reinjected.  Cost is the
    original observation's char count (no shell call, no LLM call).
``_recall_meta §<id>``
    Only ``cmd``, ``rc``, ``lines``, ``chars`` plus the existing
    ``head``/``tail`` preview is reinjected.  Bounded (~600 chars) and
    intentionally cheap; used by the LLM as a *preview* before deciding
    whether to do a full recall.

## Recall protocol for elided observations

Your context window is finite. When older observations are elided to
keep your context within the model's limit, they are NOT deleted — each
is preserved verbatim in a server-side lossless store and represented to
you as a citation of the form

    §<obs_id>  cmd=...  rc=...  lines=...  chars=...
    head: <first 200 characters of the original output>
    tail: <last 200 characters of the original output>
    [to recall full output: issue `_recall §<obs_id>` as your ONLY action — no output follows]

You have two retrieval primitives:

1.  `_recall §<obs_id>`   — re-inject the FULL verbatim observation as
    your next user-role observation. Use when you actually need the body
    (e.g. the head/tail preview is insufficient).

2.  `_recall_meta §<obs_id>`  — re-inject ONLY the metadata block
    (cmd, rc, lines, chars, head, tail). Use as a cheap preview when you
    are unsure whether the full body is worth pulling, or when the
    citation itself was already evicted by re-compaction.

Each of these must be your entire single action. They are NOT shell
commands: they are intercepted before execution. No subprocess, no extra
LLM call. The result will appear in your next observation wrapped in
``<recalled …>…</recalled>`` (full) or ``<recalled_meta …>…</recalled_meta>``
(metadata only).

IMPORTANT: issue the recall command as your ONLY action — do NOT append
simulated output or any other text after it. The actual result will
appear automatically in your next observation.

Constraints:
  * At most {recall_per_step} recall(s) of either kind per single response.
  * Recall an obs_id that you actually see in the current context. If you
    guess and the id is unknown, you will get a helpful error listing
    close matches; act on that hint, do not retry with random ids.
  * After a recall, continue with a normal action on your next response.
