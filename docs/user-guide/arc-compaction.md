# Addressable context compaction

`onecomp.compaction` reduces an agent's model-visible history while preserving
large tool results in an exact, addressable archive. The production
`formal-v1` profile is dependency-free and can run independently of model
quantization, distillation, or a GPU.

## Quick start

```python
from onecomp import CompactionConfig, CompactionRunner

config = CompactionConfig.persistent(
    ".onecomp/compaction",
    keep_recent=2,
    summary_max_chars=12_000,
    max_recall_units=2_048,
)

with CompactionRunner(config) as compactor:
    record = compactor.record_observation(
        command="pytest -q",
        content=large_test_output,
        source_key="tool-call-0182",
        returncode=1,
        tags=["test"],
    )
    messages.append(compactor.make_observation_message(record))
    messages[:] = compactor.enforce_char_budget(messages, 24_000)

    # Use the host tokenizer when a character envelope is not authoritative.
    messages[:] = compactor.enforce_token_budget(messages, 6_000, count_message_tokens)
```

`make_observation_message(record, rendered=...)` accepts a templated wrapper
only when it contains the complete archived body. If a framework intentionally
shows a different representation, pass `trusted_rendering=True`; recall still
returns the exact archived body. OneComp records this distinction in private
message metadata and removes it before provider dispatch.

`source_key` is the host's tool-call or event identifier. A retry with the same
key and identical data returns the same observation ID. Reusing the key with
different data fails. Two different calls receive different IDs even when
their command and output are byte-for-byte identical. If the host does not
provide a stable occurrence identifier, omit `source_key`: OneComp preserves
each call as a distinct occurrence instead of guessing that equal content is a
retry.

## Exact recovery

The model-facing grammar is deliberately strict:

```text
_catalog [start|cursor] [limit]
_catalog find <command-or-tag>
_recall_meta §<id>
_recall §<id>
_recall_chunk §<id> <index>
_recall_range §<id> <start>:<end>
```

A full recall that cannot fit `max_recall_units` is rejected. The caller must
use deterministic chunks or a half-open character range. Adjacent chunks
reconstruct the original Unicode string exactly; each catalog row carries the
body SHA-256 without exposing the body.

```python
response = compactor.handle_action(f"_recall_chunk §{record.obs_id} 0")
assert response is not None and response.exact
print(response.body)
```

The model action above uses persistent character ranges. The separate host API
for token-ID chunks is scoped to the exact codec version, special-token policy,
and `max_tokens` used for that call; its numeric chunk indices are not durable
across a codec-profile change. Exact token reconstruction concatenates all
`token_ids` in span order and decodes once. Do not concatenate independently
decoded per-chunk preview text.

Previews inside citations are explicitly non-authoritative. Copy exact values
only from a successful recall. `citation_head_chars` and
`citation_tail_chars` independently bound the two previews; short bodies are
shown once rather than duplicated where those windows overlap.

Formal archives maintain an exact-filtered SQLite trigram index when the local
SQLite build provides FTS5. Progress checks and body-substring lookups use the
index for literals of at least three characters and retain a literal scan
fallback, so acceleration does not change exact match semantics.

Exact range and default character-chunk recalls use a sparse block index of
UTF-8 byte offsets and per-block hashes. The canonical body remains stored once;
only overlapping blocks are read and verified. Archives created before this
index are verified and backfilled transparently on first partial recall.
Persistent MCP sessions also hold a non-blocking OS lease beside the archive,
preventing two local server processes from sharing one session's recall state.
`max_archive_bytes` limits canonical UTF-8 body bytes, not SQLite pages, indexes,
WAL sidecars, or filesystem allocation. Deployments that require a hard disk
ceiling must additionally enforce a filesystem/volume quota and retention policy.

## Guard the final provider request

Compacting an intermediate list is not enough to prove a context bound. Tool
schemas, role wrappers, images, and provider serialization can add tokens. Put
the authoritative counter at the final dispatch boundary:

```python
from onecomp.compaction.adapters import GuardedProviderAdapter

adapter = GuardedProviderAdapter(
    compactor,
    count_request=provider_token_counter,
)
result = adapter.dispatch(
    {"model": model_name, "messages": messages, "tools": tools},
    provider_client,
    compact_to_chars=24_000,
)

audit = adapter.audit()
assert audit.checked_requests == audit.dispatched_requests
assert audit.dispatch_failures == 0
```

Configure `context_window`, `completion_reserve`, and a conservative
`serialization_margin` in `CompactionConfig`. An oversized final request is
rejected before the provider function is called. The adapter also replaces the
host-owned transcript only after that final request passes the guard. A rejected
candidate leaves the source transcript unchanged. Retaining only a compacted
copy while leaving a successfully dispatched private history untouched is not
supported.

## Standalone CLI

```bash
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json init

# Agent-safe command boundary: short output passes through, verbose output is archived.
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json run -- pytest -q

onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json record \
  --command "pytest -q" --content-file test-output.txt \
  --source-key tool-call-0182 --tag test

onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json catalog --query pytest
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json recall OBS_ID
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json recall OBS_ID --kind chunk --chunk-index 0
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json doctor
```

Exact full/chunk/range bodies are written directly to stdout for lossless shell
redirection. `export` omits bodies and free-form host extras unless
`--include-bodies` is explicitly supplied. File exports and legacy migrations
stream bounded batches instead of materializing every archived body at once.
Body-free is not secret-free: command signatures, source identifiers, tags,
paths, and hashes remain metadata and may still be sensitive. Apply a
deployment-specific command/metadata redaction policy before sharing exports.

`run` executes an argv list without a shell. It preserves the child exit status
and combines stdout/stderr in execution order. Long UTF-8 output becomes a
bounded citation only after its archive transaction commits. Archive failure,
non-UTF-8 output, or output above `--max-output-bytes` fails open and returns the
original bytes. Interactive terminals stream command progress to stderr while
keeping stdout reserved for the final citation. Use `--tee` to enable this in
CI, or `--no-tee` to keep stderr quiet. After `--max-output-bytes` is crossed,
the original stream is forwarded immediately without growing the temporary
capture. Use `onecomp-arc guide --host codex` to print concise project
instructions for a coding agent. `--config` is accepted before or after the
subcommand. Configuration and redacted export files use private, atomic writes;
an existing destination is not overwritten unless the corresponding force
option is explicit.

`init --durability full` is the default and fsyncs body transactions. Select
`--durability normal` only when higher ingestion throughput is worth relaxing
power-loss durability; SQLite transaction and process-crash recovery remain.
Recall counters are telemetry rather than recovery data and are flushed in a
batch at status, report, export, and clean close boundaries.

To migrate the earlier JSONL format without changing old citations:

```bash
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json migrate old.wal --dry-run
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json migrate old.wal
```

For a WAL that may move or grow, supply a stable identity:

```bash
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json migrate old.wal \
  --migration-id my-agent-session
```

The migration API exposes the same value as `migration_id`. Re-running an
import with the same identity imports only newly appended line occurrences.
Formal archives also verify immutable record metadata, body hashes, occurrence
IDs, sequence counters, and byte counters when reopened.

## Agent-host integration

### Claude Code hook

Install the `PostToolUse` hook using the environment's entry point:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash|Read|Grep|Glob",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/path/to/venv/bin/onecomp-arc-hook --platform claude"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Claude output replacement preserves known built-in output shapes and fails open
for unknown structured or multimodal shapes. This avoids converting a valid
host payload into a text-only shape that the host cannot apply.

Set `ONECOMP_ARC_HOOK_ROOT` to a dedicated private directory. A tool result is
replaced only after its SQLite transaction commits. The generated citation
contains a bounded `onecomp-arc-recall` command addressed through the same
Python environment as the hook, so it does not depend on the agent shell's
`PATH`. Recall opens the committed archive read-only and therefore also works
when the agent sandbox can read, but cannot mutate, the hook cache. Recall
telemetry is intentionally not persisted at this read-only boundary. Use
`--max-archive-bytes BYTES` when the hook process itself must enforce a per-session
UTF-8 body quota.

### Codex hook and command boundary

The current Codex `PostToolUse` contract replaces a completed tool result with
the hook `reason` when `decision` is `block`. OneComp exposes this behavior as
`--codex-result-mode replace`, the default. The original result commits before
the bounded citation is returned. The standalone boundary remains useful for
older host versions and commands outside the hook contract:

```bash
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json run -- pytest -q
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json run -- rg pattern src tests
```

On POSIX systems, `run` isolates the command in its own process group. A
configured timeout terminates descendants as well as the direct child, including
a grandchild that still owns the captured output pipe. `--max-output-bytes`
switches to exact fail-open streaming instead of loading an oversized result into
memory or emitting a citation that was not archived.

`context` is an explicit archival-only compatibility mode that retains native
output. `block` aliases `replace` at the current wire layer, while `stop` uses
the universal continuation contract. Validate host upgrades against the
checked-in contract test before relying on replacement.

### OpenCode

Generate a typed plugin and place it in the host's plugin directory:

```bash
onecomp-arc --config .onecomp/compaction/config.json plugin \
  --host opencode --output .opencode/plugins/onecomp-compaction.ts
```

The plugin keys persistence by `sessionID` and `callID`, replaces
`output.output` in `tool.execute.after`, and adds recall guidance during
`experimental.session.compacting`.

### OpenHands SDK

The optional adapter emits a native `Condensation`, so forgotten events are
actually removed from the model view. It registers paired recall and catalog
tools backed by the same formal archive. Install it with
`pip install onecomp[openhands]`; the SDK is intentionally not a OneComp core
dependency. The adapter is exercised against the SDK's immutable `View`,
manipulation boundaries, rolling-condenser lifecycle, and native tool schema.
A recalled observation retains its original occurrence identity when condensed
again, so the recall tool does not recursively create duplicate archive rows.

### MCP

`onecomp-mcp` starts in automatic protocol mode and exposes authenticated
formal sessions by default. MCP provides storage and recall, but a stock MCP
tool cannot mutate its host's private transcript. Automatic reduction still
requires a condenser, hook, or custom host that applies the returned message
list. See the [MCP guide](mcp-server.md).

`compaction_verify_value` supports the backward-compatible substring check,
an `exact_line` mode, an optional literal prefix, and optional binding to one
`obs_id`. Prefer the strongest available combination before an agent copies a
credential-like or task-critical value. Persistent sessions hold both an
in-process lease and a non-blocking OS lock, so separate local MCP processes
cannot share one archive's per-step recall state.

## Single-run evidence

```python
from onecomp.analyzer.compaction import (
    build_run_report,
    save_run_report,
    visualize_run,
)

report = build_run_report(compactor, run_name="repository agent")
save_run_report(report, "results/run-report.json")
visualize_run(report, "results/run-dashboard")
```

Reports and plots include operation timing, compaction trajectory, archive
sizes, recall mix, and checksum coverage. Observation bodies and free-form
extras are excluded, but command/path/tag metadata can still be sensitive. The
dashboard uses a white, print-friendly run view with
bounded labels and high-cardinality aggregation. Use the public deterministic
benchmark for comparable measurements:

```bash
python benchmark/compaction/run_benchmark.py \
  --output-dir results/compaction/formal-v1
```

## Guarantees and qualification boundary

`formal-v1` provides the following when its integration contract is followed:

- append-only occurrence identity with fixed-width IDs,
- idempotent host-event retries and conflict detection,
- transactional body/ID commit and crash-safe SQLite WAL persistence,
- indexed literal progress checks with exact post-filtering and a portable fallback,
- exact full, range, text-chunk, and token-ID reconstruction,
- complete body-free catalog pagination,
- bounded model-facing recall responses,
- an auditable final provider-request guard,
- body-free status, report, and visualization telemetry.

Compaction summaries carry private, hash-checked structured entries while they
remain in the host-owned buffer. Re-compaction therefore adjusts individual
trajectory entries and observation handles instead of reparsing a free-form
summary string. Private provenance fields are removed before provider dispatch.

The following remain deployment responsibilities:

- choose an authoritative tokenizer and accurate serialization margin,
- secure the archive directory, backups, and process account,
- encrypt storage at the filesystem or volume layer when required,
- define retention/deletion policy outside the append-only archive,
- redact sensitive command and metadata fields before external sharing,
- validate each host version's hook/condenser contract,
- account for multimodal payloads in the final provider counter.

The compatibility-only `experimental-v1` profile preserves earlier behavior
but does not carry the formal guarantees above.
